# Netflix-Stock-Prediction-Time-Series-

## Overview
This project aims to predict the future stock prices of Netflix (NFLX) using time series analysis techniques. By analyzing historical stock price data and identifying patterns, trends, and seasonality, the goal is to develop a predictive model that can forecast Netflix's stock prices with reasonable accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of historical daily stock price data for Netflix. It includes information such as the opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, and trading volume for each trading day. The dataset covers a period of several years, allowing for comprehensive analysis and modeling.

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features such as moving averages, volatility, and seasonality indicators.
- Data Transformation: Normalize or scale the data as needed for modeling.
  
### Time Series Analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the time series data to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality.
- Model Selection: Choose appropriate time series forecasting models, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, based on the data characteristics and requirements.
- Model Training: Split the dataset into training and validation sets, and train the selected models on the training data.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
  
## Results
After rigorous analysis and modeling, the developed predictive model achieves satisfactory performance in forecasting Netflix stock prices. The model's accuracy and reliability are evaluated based on the chosen evaluation metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting future stock price movements.

## Future Enhancements
- Ensemble Methods: Explore ensemble methods such as combining multiple forecasting models to improve prediction accuracy.
- Incorporate External Factors: Integrate external factors such as macroeconomic indicators, news sentiment analysis, or industry trends to enhance the forecasting model's robustness.
- Real-time Prediction: Develop a real-time prediction system that continuously updates forecasts based on incoming data.
